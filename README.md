	* ListBigFiles.rb and ShrinkRepo.rb are files from https://www.rallydev.com/blog/engineering/shrinking-git-repository-move-githubcom
		* Usage : Under a Linux computer (must be able to run Ruby & tail, basically) run `ruby ../ListBigFiles.rb 1000 > ../biggestfile` from your git folder repo then, at the same place, run `ruby ShrinkRepo.rb`
		* What it does: It gather all the 1000 biggest file, and removes them from your git history except those that are still present
		* Used it in this repo: from 9xx mb to 1xx mb
